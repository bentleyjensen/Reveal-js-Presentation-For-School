## JS is cool

This slide has some notes. Hit s.

Notes:
Glenn, I was thinking you could open about why the project initially went in this direction especially but I thought it would work well for you to start the talk and frame the why of it all

## Some JS

```
// comment
var x = 100,
    y = ['a', 100, {}],
    z = {
        x: 'z'
    };
// IIFE
(function ($, window, undefined) {
    // What am I doing?
    var _test = function () {};
    return {
        test: _test
    };
})(jQuery, window)
```
